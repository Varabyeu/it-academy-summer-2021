# You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People
# can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the
# text that should be displayed next to such an item.
# Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input
# array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the
# display text as shown in the examples:
# likes([]) # must be "no one likes this"
# likes(["Peter"]) # must be "Peter likes this"
# likes(["Jacob", "Alex"]) # must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
# likes(["Max", "John", "Mark"]) # must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
# likes(["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]) # must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others
